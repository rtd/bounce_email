# bounce-email

This Ruby library is for determining the bounce type of an email message. It determines whether the bounce is hard or soft, if is an "out of office mail", etc.

## Build Status
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mitio/bounce_email.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mitio/bounce_email)

## SYNOPSIS:

Follow this tutorial to handle bounce-emails: [http://keakaj.com/wisdom/2007/08/08/verp-on-rails](http://keakaj.com/wisdom/2007/08/08/verp-on-rails/)

Basic usage:

     require "bounce_email"

     bounce = BounceEmail::Mail.new(STDIN.read)

     # Do something with bounce info
     bounce.bounced? # true/false
     bounce.code # e.g. "5.1.1"
     bounce.reason # e.g. "Something about the address specified in the message caused this DSN."
     bounce.type  #  "Permanent Failure", "Persistent Transient Failure", "Success" -- BounceEmail::TYPE_HARD_FAIL, TYPE_SOFT_FAIL, TYPE_SUCCESS


## REQUIREMENTS:

Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.x and the [mail](http://rubygems.org/gems/mail) Ruby gem are required.
The gem is used for primary bounce handling, which catches about 50% of all bounces.
For most other bounces, this gem comes in. See discussion here: [https://github.com/mikel/mail/issues/103](https://github.com/mikel/mail/issues/103)

## Other implementations:

  * (PERL) [https://github.com/rjbs/mail-deliverystatus-bounceparser](https://github.com/rjbs/mail-deliverystatus-bounceparser)


## TODO:

  * Mode code cleanup.
  * Don't hardcode comparison strings, move to external file which can be extended easily.
  * More test: extend for more bounces.
  * Is OUT of office type needed? If yes, implement as an optional part.
  * Merge into Mail Gem?

## CONTRIBUTIONS:

Please fork on github & add new conditions under "get_status_from_text" if you discover creative new mailserver responses.
